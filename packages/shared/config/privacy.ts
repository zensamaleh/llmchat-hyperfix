### Data Handling Information

#### We Collect

We collect two types of information:

1. **User-Provided Information**:

   - When you register for an account or use our Service, you may provide us with personal information such as your name, email address, and other contact details.
   - Specifically, if you wish to use the freely available GPT-4o mini model API calls, you are required to log in via Google or GitHub. This usage is limited to 10 messages a day to ensure fair usage.
   - All the data related to this is stored locally on your browser.

2. **Automatically Collected Information**:
   - When you access the Service, certain information may be collected automatically. This includes your IP address, browser type, device type, and other technical information.
   - We may also use cookies and similar tracking technologies to collect data about your interactions with our Service.

### How We Handle Your Data

- **Local Storage**: All your data, including API keys, chat history, and messages, are stored locally on your browser using Local Storage and IndexedDB. We do not have a backend server to collect or store your data.
- **Secure Requests**: When you send a message, your browser directly communicates with the API server using a secure HTTPS connection. There is no middle server, ensuring your data remains private.
- **Proxy Requests**: For certain models, requests are forwarded through our proxy server without logging or storing any data. The proxy server simply passes your request to the model's server.
- **No External JavaScript**: We do not run any external JavaScript on our site, ensuring high security and privacy.
- **Data Deletion**: You can delete all your data, including API keys, configurations, and chat histories, at any time from your browser.
- **Tracking and Cookies**: We may use tracking and error logging tools to improve our services. Cookies might be used to enhance user experience and functionality.

### Use of Third-Party Services

Our Service may use third-party tools and services to assist in analytics, service optimization, or for technical support. These may include:

- **PostHog**: Used for analytics to better understand user interactions with our Service.
- **Sentry**: Used for error logging and monitoring to improve the stability and performance of our Service.

These third-party services have their own Privacy Policies, which we recommend you review.
